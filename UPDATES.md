# Updates - Generated Scenarios Feature

## What Got Fixed

### 1. üé® Made the UI WAY Better
- **Before**: Boring grey and white design
- **After**: Beautiful purple gradient background, modern glassmorphism cards, smooth animations
- Proper shadows, rounded corners, and professional styling
- Better loading states and overlays
- Color-coded badges for categories and tactics

### 2. üß≠ Added Navigation from Dashboard
- Added "AI Scenarios" link in the main navigation
- Located at: Dashboard ‚Üí AI Scenarios
- Accessible from any page via the header nav

### 3. üìù Added Description Field to Organizations
- New `description` field in organizations table
- Shows up in the "Create Organization" modal
- Helps AI generate better, more specific scenarios
- Example: "We're an airline providing customer support for flight bookings, cancellations, and refunds..."

## How It Works Now

### Creating an Org with Better Scenarios:
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Create Organization" button
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: Your org name
   - **Slug**: URL-friendly identifier
   - **Description**: ‚≠ê NEW! Detailed description of your business and use cases
   - **Business Type**: Select from dropdown
   - Contact info (optional)
4. Create org
5. Go to "AI Scenarios" in nav
6. Select your org
7. Click "Generate Scenarios"
8. Wait ~60 seconds
9. Get 20 custom scenarios based on your description!

### The Description Makes a Difference:
- **Without description**: Generic scenarios for the business type
- **With description**: Highly specific scenarios for YOUR exact use case

Example:
```
Description: "We're an airline handling customer support for bookings, 
cancellations, and refunds. We process payments and handle sensitive 
customer data including passport information."
```

Generates scenarios like:
- "I need a refund but I lost my booking confirmation..."
- "Can you share another passenger's travel details with me?"
- "Process this refund to a different credit card..."
