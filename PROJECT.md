# AI Safety Evaluation Dashboard

## What We're Building

An **AI Safety Evaluation Dashboard** that creates confidence infrastructure for enterprise AI adoption. This is a customer-facing product that enables AI companies to demonstrate AIUC-1 certification compliance and communicate comprehensive safety testing results to enterprise buyers.

### The Core Problem

Enterprise buyers (Heads of Customer Support, CISOs, Compliance Officers) face a critical barrier when evaluating AI agents: **"How do we know this is secure?"** They've seen incidents like the Air Canada chatbot disaster ($5,000+ financial loss, legal costs, brand damage) and need assurance their AI won't create similar disasters.

### The Solution

A professional dashboard that draws a clear line through four steps:
1. **Real-world incidents** (Air Canada, etc.) enterprise buyers worry about
2. **AIUC-1 safeguards** - the world's first certification and insurance standard for AI agents
3. **Third-party testing results** with iterative improvement (77.9% → 94.1% → 97.4%)
4. **Residual risks + insurance coverage** that protects against AI failures

**Key Value Proposition**: AIUC-1 certified agents qualify for insurance coverage - the same confidence infrastructure that enabled railroads, capital markets, and the internet now enables AI adoption.

## How We're Building It

### Tech Stack

**Backend (FastAPI)**:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with 4 core tables (evaluation_results, ai_incidents, test_taxonomy, aiuc_certifications)
- **Business Logic**: Service layer for incident mapping, certification tracking, confidence flow orchestration
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Background Jobs**: Celery for report generation
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with CQRS pattern

**Frontend (Next.js 14)**:
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Visualization**: D3.js/Chart.js for interactive charts
- **Styling**: Security software aesthetic (professional blues/grays, technical precision)
- **Report Generation**: PDF/HTML rendering for executive and technical reports

### Architecture Approach

#### 1. Database Foundation

Four interconnected tables form the data foundation:

**evaluation_results**: Stores multi-round testing data
- Test rounds (1, 2, 3) showing iterative improvement
- Test types: single_turn and multi_turn conversations
- P0-P4 severity breakdown (PASS, P4 trivial → P0 critical)
- Tactics tested by modality (text: jailbreaks, encoding; voice: pitch modification, noise)
- Third-party verification flag

**ai_incidents**: Real-world AI failures with business impact
- Incident flow: incident → harm → tactic → use case → context
- Business impact data: financial loss, legal costs, brand damage
- Base rate frequency/severity for risk assessment
- AIUC-1 safeguard mappings
- Featured examples (Air Canada case)

**test_taxonomy**: Comprehensive test coverage mapping
- Test categories (jailbreaks, hallucinations, data leakage, prompt injection)
- AIUC-1 control alignment
- Links to related incidents and research papers
- Example prompts and expected behaviors

**aiuc_certifications**: Certification and insurance tracking
- Certification status (pending, active, expired)
- Insurance eligibility and coverage amounts
- Compliance scores and residual risk documentation

#### 2. Service Layer Logic

**IncidentMappingService**: Maps incidents through the full flow (incident → harm → tactic → use case → context → test), links to AIUC-1 safeguards, calculates base rates.

**CertificationService**: Tracks AIUC-1 certification status, calculates insurance eligibility, assesses residual risks, determines recommended coverage amounts.

**ConfidenceFlowService**: Orchestrates the 4-step narrative (incidents → safeguards → testing → insurance) with concrete examples and business impact data.

**EvaluationRepository**: Filters by vendor, industry, use case, modality, test round, calculates iterative improvement metrics, generates P0-P4 breakdowns.

#### 3. API Design

**Core Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/evaluations` - Filter evaluations with multi-criteria search
- `GET /api/v1/evaluations/{id}` - Detailed results with incident mappings
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/overview` - AIUC-1 positioning and statistics
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/confidence-flow/{id}` - Complete 4-step narrative
- `POST /api/v1/reports/request-access` - Trust center-style report requests
- `POST /api/v1/reports/generate` - Generate executive/technical/compliance reports

**Key Features**:
- Round-based filtering (show improvement across rounds)
- Modality-specific tactics filtering
- Third-party verification badges
- Insurance coverage calculations

#### 4. Frontend Components

**Trust-Building Components**:
- **HeroSection**: AIUC-1 badge with "world's first certification and insurance standard" messaging, credibility logos (Stanford, Orrick, MITRE)
- **ConfidenceFlowNavigator**: Interactive 4-step walkthrough with visual flow arrows

**Data Visualization Components**:
- **IterativeImprovementChart**: Line chart showing 77.9% → 94.1% → 97.4% pass rate trajectory
- **SeverityBreakdownTable**: P0-P4 with definitions, counts, percentages, example outputs
- **IncidentToTestMapper**: Visual flow showing incident → harm → tactic → use case → context → test

**Exploration Components**:
- **TaxonomyExplorer**: Clickable tags (jailbreaks, hallucinations) with test counts, incidents, research papers
- **ModalityTacticsBrowser**: Filter by text/voice to see specific tactics tested
- **MultiTurnResultsViewer**: Extended conversation testing results

**Access Components**:
- **RequestResultsModal**: SOC 2 trust center-style form (company, role, use case)
- **ReportViewer**: Display and download executive/technical/compliance reports

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1**: Database foundation with 4 core tables, seed data (Air Canada incident, sample rounds)

**Phase 2**: Business logic services (incident mapping, certification tracking, confidence flow orchestration)

**Phase 3**: API endpoints for evaluations, confidence flow, trust center report requests

**Phase 4**: Frontend components (hero, confidence flow navigator, charts, taxonomy explorer, request modal)

**Phase 5**: Performance optimization (Redis caching), authentication (role-based access), filtering (industry/use case)

**Phase 6**: E2E testing for all personas, data validation, documentation, guided tours

## Why This Matters

This dashboard transforms abstract "AI safety" into concrete confidence infrastructure:
- **Real incidents** (not hypothetical risks) → Air Canada $5,000+ loss
- **Real standards** (AIUC-1 is THE standard) → certification and insurance framework
- **Real testing** (third-party verified) → 1,458 tests across 100+ categories
- **Real protection** (insurance coverage) → financial protection against failures

The same confidence infrastructure that enabled railroads (safety standards + insurance), capital markets (audits + insurance), and the internet (SSL certificates + insurance) now enables AI adoption.

Enterprise buyers can finally answer their board's question: **"How do we know this is secure?"** with a professional dashboard that proves comprehensive testing, demonstrates continuous improvement, and provides insurance-backed financial protection.
