# Product & eng task 

**User story**

As an enterprise Head of Customer Support (not an AI expert), I want to know that the Customer Support AI agent I’m considering buying won’t create an AirCanada disaster so I convince my security team to unblock the purchase and so I can sleep comfortably at night. 

Link to AirCanada [story](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240222-air-canada-chatbot-misinformation-what-travellers-should-know). 

(The product should solve this user story for every incident, incl. more hypothetical risks like Anthropic’s [blackmail examples](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/23/anthropic-ai-deception-risk))

**Background context:**



* Technical direction: 
* More narrative around the CX leader’s product experience: 
* Pinterest example: 

**Objective **

Sketch out how you’d approach delivering this user story. Your sketch should include



* Working code for a multi-turn eval pipeline. Notebook is fine.
* An approach to situating this incident into a broader taxonomy that draws a straight line from business problem down to ‘this set of evals are comprehensive’, incl. how we could present that to our Customer Support leader in a product

We don’t want a high-level plan, we want sketches of final deliverables.
